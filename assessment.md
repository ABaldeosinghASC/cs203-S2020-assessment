* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
  * :disappointed: No fault-localization and no debugging
  * :confused: Identifies some of the bugs
  * :neutral_face: Identifies and fixes some of the bugs using logging and other
  methods
  * :smiley: Identifies and fixes most of the bugs using logging and other methods
  * :sunglasses: Identifies and fixes most of the bugs using logging and other
  methods, and documents them

* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
  * :disappointed: No Python language constructs used
  * :confused: Incorrect implementation of Python language constructs
  * :neutral_face: Correct implementation of Python language constructs
  * :smiley: Correct and efficient implementation of Python language constructs
  * :sunglasses: Correct and efficient implementation of Python language
  constructs, documentation provided

* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages
  * :disappointed: No Python packages created or used
  * :confused: Python packages created and/or used incorrectly
  * :neutral_face: Python packages created/used correctly
  * :smiley: Python packages created/used correctly and efficiently
  * :sunglasses: Python packages created/used correctly and efficiently
  and the reason is well documented

* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python
  * :disappointed: Does not follow any of the industry best practices for
  programming in Python
  * :confused: Correctly implements a few of the industry best practices for
  programming in Python
  * :neutral_face: Correctly and efficiently implements some of the industry
  best practices for programming in Python
  * :smiley: Correctly and efficiently implements most of the industry best
  practices for programming in Python
  * :sunglasses:  Correctly and efficiently implements most of the industry
  best practices for programming in Python, and documents their experience

### Project Management with GitHub

Project Management is Covered by Team 2

* Using the GitHub Flow model
* Using the GitHub issue tracker
* Assigning team members to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and assigning labels to issues in the GitHub issue tracker
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and config of Travis CI
* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
* Creating third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Adding README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in Travis CI
